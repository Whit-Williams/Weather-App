# The Weather App 

Welcome to the Weather App.

Following on from last week's lesson on server APIs, I have created a weather application using JQuery, Bootstrap and the Open Weather Map API.

## About The Project

The task for this challenge was to build a weather app powered by the OpenWeatherMap API, that can take a city name as input and call the data for both the current day and a five day forecast for the searched city. Upon searching the city, it is also added to a history column as a button, that can be clicked to retrieve the weather information again.

- Day.js
- Open Weather Map API
- jQuery

### Key Features
- Displays the current day's weather forecast, including the searched city name and the current date, updated dynamically.
- Displays the five day forecast for the city.
- A search function that saves past searches as buttons in a history section.
- Saves the search information to local storage when the search button is clicked.
- History buttons that can be clicked to retrieve weather data.
